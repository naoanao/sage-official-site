## Introduction to AI-Powered Voice Assistants
The world of artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with the rise of chatbots and voice assistants being two of the most notable developments. While chatbots have been widely adopted in customer service and support, voice assistants have been primarily used for personal assistance and smart home automation. However, the potential of AI-powered voice assistants extends far beyond these applications, particularly for solopreneurs looking to unlock new streams of passive income.
