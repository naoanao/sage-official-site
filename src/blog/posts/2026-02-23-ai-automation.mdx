# How I Shipped 27 Social Posts Autonomously in One Month

Last month, Sage posted **27 times across Instagram and Bluesky** with zero manual input. Here's the exact breakdown of how it works.

## The Setup (One Time Only)

1. Add content to a Notion database with status "Ready"
2. Sage's scheduler checks Notion every hour
3. Groq AI generates captions and image prompts
4. Image is created and uploaded automatically
5. Posts go live on Instagram + Bluesky simultaneously

Total setup time: **under 20 minutes.**

## What the Numbers Look Like

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Posts shipped | 27 |
| Platforms | Instagram + Bluesky |
| Manual work | 0 hours |
| Success rate | 100% |

## Why This Matters

Most solopreneurs spend 8–12 hours per week on social media. That's 48+ hours per month — time that could go toward building products, landing clients, or just living your life.

With Sage running in the background, those 48 hours are yours again.

## The Content Strategy

Sage doesn't just post randomly. Each post is:
- Pulled from a curated Notion content calendar
- Rewritten by Groq's LLM for platform-specific tone
- Paired with a relevant AI-generated image
- Tagged and captioned for maximum reach
